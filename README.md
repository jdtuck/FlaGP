The FlaGP package implements a fast algorithm for modeling functional response data built upon local gaussian process prediction.

A number of examples are available which detail how to fit the FlaGP model, and calibrate the model to observed data when available.

The code is currently still under development, but is validated through the available examples. We recommend the use of the FlaGP-C 
branch, as this branch incorporates C code which dramatically speeds up the algorithm as compared to FlaGP-R.
